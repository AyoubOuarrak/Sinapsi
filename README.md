#Sinapsi  
_Distributed intelligent automation system_  
  
Sinapsi gives you the ability to interconnect your devices in a very simple way, using a macro editor you can define a 
set of actions to be performed when a trigger is activated. For example, with a well formed macro, you can display a 
notification on your PC when the smartphone battery is running low. Unlike other applications of this kind, 
Sinapsi gives the ability to perform actions on multiple devices not necessarily in the same local network, 
thus generating a network of distributed devices which act and react with each other.
Sinapsi will be able to run on Android, Windows, Linux and Mac, future updates will bring Sinapsi on 
iOS devices and will allow a voice interface to interact with other devices.
